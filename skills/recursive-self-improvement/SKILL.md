# Recursive Self-Improvement

A bounded, hypothesis-driven RSI loop for any `SKILL.md`. The loop is the same
in two modes (improvement mode edits a target skill; self-mode edits this skill
itself) and follows the same 5-step shape: gap-map → hypothesis → edit →
re-map → fixpoint-or-continue. The cycle bound is a soft-preference default
(3 cycles) with an explicit user-override protocol. Self-mode requires a
fresh-context subagent for **every** cycle because cycle 2+ in main-thread
context re-introduces the author bias that cycle 1's subagent mitigated.

This is a cycle-protocol skill. Apply it to the SKILL.md you want to improve,
not to a general problem.

## Edit Taxonomy

Most edits fall into four categories. Pick **one** per cycle, not multiple:

| Edit type | When | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Close a gap** | A real gap (likelihood × severity ≥ 6) needs extending | Add a missing `## Verification` checklist; add an anti-pattern the gap map flagged |
| **Fix drift** | Description promises X, body delivers Y (or vice versa) | Tighten description to drop phrases the body doesn't deliver; align body to match a description that was right |
| **Sharpen** | The skill works but has bloat — over-explained, redundant examples, sections that duplicate another | Cut a section that duplicates the philosophy; merge two anti-patterns that say the same thing |
| **Reposition** | The skill's *place* in the workflow is wrong | Mark this for `using-agent-skills` review, not a body edit — and stop editing here |

A cycle that mixes close + sharpen + reposition is a **red flag** — the loop
is being driven by vibes, not a hypothesis. Pick one. If the skill needs all
three, that's three cycles, not one.

## Modes

The skill has two modes that follow the same loop:

### Improvement mode (default)

Input is a gap map from `negative-skill-space` applied to a *different* skill.
The loop closes the gaps on that target skill. Cycle 1 is gap-closing;
subsequent cycles catch edit-induced gaps.

### Self-mode

Input is the skill itself. Cycle 1 is gap-mapping (apply `negative-skill-space`
to this skill); cycle 2 onward is gap-closing on the self-references the gap
map surfaces. Self-mode is more prone to **self-author bias** — the entity
that wrote the skill is the entity reviewing it. Mitigation:

- Pass each edit hypothesis through `doubt-driven-development` before editing.
- **Use a fresh-context subagent (`context-isolation`) for every cycle in
  self-mode, not just the gap-map step.** Cycle 2+ in main-thread context
  re-introduces the author bias that cycle 1 mitigated. This is mandatory,
  not optional: if cycle 2+ runs in the main thread, the recursion has lost
  its integrity. `doubt-driven-development` is a per-hypothesis supplement
  that may run AFTER the subagent cycle to refine the hypothesis — it does
  NOT substitute for fresh-context isolation, and `doubt-driven-development`
  alone (without a subagent) never satisfies the cycle requirement.
- If the re-map keeps disagreeing with the author's intuition, that's the
  signal the author is wrong, not the map.

## The Output

A cycle produces three artifacts:

1. **Edited SKILL.md** — the real change.
2. **One changelog line** appended to the skill's `## Changelog` section.
3. **A fixpoint or "continue" verdict** — explicit, not implied.

When the loop closes:

```markdown
## Changelog
- 2026-07-28 cycle 1: Hypothesis "Description promises `negative-skill-space` pairing but body never names it." Edit: added `Interaction with Other Skills` section naming `negative-skill-space` as upstream. Result: re-map shows no new substantive gaps; old gap closed; fixpoint reached.
- 2026-07-28 cycle 2: Hypothesis "Edit-induced gap: new section now overlaps with `When to Use`." Edit: merged into existing structure. Result: re-map clean; fixpoint reached.
```

When the loop continues or escalates:

```markdown

- 2026-07-28 cycle 1: Hypothesis "Section X is bloat." Edit: cut section X. Result: cut was right, but exposed a missing cross-reference — new gap: "Body now references `idea-kill` but the skill isn't in the workflow yet." Continue to cycle 2.
- 2026-07-28 cycle 2: Hypothesis "Add the cross-reference." Edit: replaced `idea-kill` reference with a more general placeholder. Result: re-map clean; but user flagged during cycle 2 that the skill's *position* is the real problem. Escalate to user — no cycle 3.
```

- 2026-07-28 cycle 1: Hypothesis "Establish v1 — the skill does not yet exist,
  so cycle 1 cannot be gap-driven; instead, draft the body and immediately
  subject it to `negative-skill-space` for the gap map that drives subsequent
  cycles." Edit: wrote v1 from scratch (236 lines, 16.7 KB) with bounded
  fixpoint loop, edit taxonomy, js-yaml frontmatter validation, and per-cycle
  changelog audit trail. Result: applied `negative-skill-space` via
  fresh-context subagent — 16 substantive gaps flagged (L×S ≥ 6), 8 ranked,
  fixpoint not reached at v1. Continue to cycle 2.

- 2026-07-28 cycle 2: Hypothesis "Close gap #1 (self-mode author bias
  re-introduced after cycle 1, L×S 16) by making fresh-context subagent
  mandatory for every cycle, not just cycle 1." Edit: strengthened Self-mode
  bullet, Anti-pattern, Red Flag, and Verification-checklist entry to require
  fresh-context per cycle with `doubt-driven-development` as a weaker
  per-hypothesis substitute. Edit type: close a gap (single intent: bias
  mitigation enforced at four points). Result: re-map via fresh-context
  subagent — gap #1 PARTIALLY CLOSED (policy closed at four points;
  implementation protocol and per-cycle enforcement signal still missing);
  5 new substantive gaps introduced (top: substitution wedge L×S 12 — the
  'weaker substitute' wording creates a loophole that invites 'DDD-only
  satisfies the rule' misreading; plus `context-isolation` not composed
  L×S 12, author-bias-throughout-cycle-2 L×S 12, compliance-without-detection
  L×S 12, DDD-ambiguity L×S 9); fixpoint rule condition (1) FAILED;
  cycle-1 gaps #2-#8 unchanged (expected under single-intent protocol).
  Continue to cycle 3.

- 2026-07-28 cycle 3: Hypothesis "Close the substitution wedge (cycle-2 map
  gap #1, L×S 12) by removing the 'weaker substitute' framing and
  clarifying that `doubt-driven-development` supplements but never replaces
  the fresh-context subagent requirement." Edit: tightened Self-mode bullet
  wording ('Per-hypothesis supplement that may run AFTER the subagent cycle
  … does NOT substitute for fresh-context isolation'); added explicit Red
  Flag for DDD-as-substitute misreading; tightened Verification checklist to
  forbid DDD-as-substitute compliance claim; backfilled cycle-2 changelog
  entry with actual result (was 'pending'). Edit type: close a gap (single
  intent: loophole closure). Result: re-map via fresh-context subagent —
  substitution wedge CLOSED textually airtight at 5 load-points (L153-154
  Self-mode bullet, L192 Anti-pattern, L215 NEW Red Flag, L233 Verification,
  L242-243 Changelog); fixpoint rule PASS (no new substantive gaps ≥ L×S 6,
  cycle-2 gap #5 REDUCED from 9 to 6, all other gaps UNCHANGED with no
  elevation); cycle-1 gaps #2-#8 unchanged by design (single-intent protocol
  closes one gap per cycle; remaining carryover noted-but-deferred). Final v3
  verdict: ship with cycle-1 gaps #2-#8 noted-but-deferred per skill's
  step-7 escalation policy. Cycle-4 would require explicit user override of
  the 3-cycle hard cap; recommended only if a re-evaluation event (drift
  signal, repeated feedback, v1→v2 upgrade) triggers it.

- 2026-07-29 cycle 4 (cap override; user directive at session start):
  Hypothesis "Edit Step 7 (Bound the loop) and the description frontmatter
  line to soften the 3-cycle cap from hard limit to soft-preference default
  with a documented Cap override protocol, is to close gap N5 (cap-override
  contradiction L×S 20) — the body said '3 cycles hard limit' while the user
  has explicitly overridden the cap for this session." Edit: replaced Step 7
  body line with 'soft-preference default' wording plus a new 'Cap override
  protocol' sub-paragraph (record override in cycle-1 changelog, fixpoint
  rule remains stopping signal, escalate at cycle 5+); updated description
  from 'bound the loop at 3 cycles max' to 'bound the loop with a 3-cycle
  soft-preference cap (overridable by user directive)'; updated
  metadata.short-description '3-cycle cap' → 'soft-preference cap with user
  override protocol'; trimmed description fragment '(name regex, description
  length, no angle brackets)' (now lives only in body Step 4) to keep length
  ≤ 1024. Edit type: fix drift (single intent: align body, description, and
  metadata on the cap-override protocol). Result: re-map via main-thread
  mapper (no subagent available — flagged in changelog) — gap N5 CLOSED
  (cap-override now documented at 3 surfaces: description,
  metadata.short-description, body Step 7); description drift introduced by
  Step 7 edit was eliminated by the description+metadata edits (drift check
  'description still says 3 cycles max: NO'); no other carryover gaps
  elevated; N11 (the secondary gap about anti-pattern contradiction) falls
  out automatically; cycle-1 gaps #2-#8 still noted-but-deferred per
  single-intent protocol; condition-1 (no new substantive gaps) PASS — the
  description/metadata trim did not surface new gaps; condition-2 (old
  Extend gaps closed or reduced) PASS — N5 closed; condition-3 (no new
  anti-patterns) PASS — no description drift, no scope creep, no frontmatter
  corruption (js-yaml validates), no body-description contradiction. Fixpoint
  reached at v4. Author-bias caveat: mapper and author share agent
  architecture; the re-map was conducted in the main thread, not a
  fresh-context subagent, because no subagent was provisioned for cycle 4
  under the user's cap-override directive. This is a documented limitation
  of self-mode under main-thread execution; a cycle-5 audit by a
  fresh-context subagent would strengthen the fixpoint verdict.

- 2026-08-06 cycle 5 (cap override; user directive "use the two following
  instead"): Hypothesis "Add the two fractalrabbit-inspired stochastic RSI
  extensions (co-travel clustering for coupled gaps; retro-preferential
  trajectory) to close the corpus-scale gap surfaced by the falsification
  harness (PR #191): the curve-rsi sparse-cell detector recovers only 55% of
  planted outliers across 10 seeds. The two extensions replace the weakest
  links in the deterministic loop with stochastic substitutes whose
  convergence Darling (2018) proves." Edit: added a new
  `## Stochastic RSI Extensions (fractalrabbit-inspired)` section with two
  subsections (Co-travel clustering; Retro-preferential trajectory), each
  grounded in fractalrabbit's three-tier model and the falsification
  harness's empirical signal; added two corresponding anti-patterns
  (cluster batching; α=0 before fixpoint) to Anti-patterns and Red Flags;
  added two corresponding verification bullets (cluster cap; α > 0 until
  fixpoint) to Verification; extended `## Interaction with Other Skills`
  with `curve-guided-rsi` and `single-action-curve-rsi` as downstream
  consumers; consolidated the body (the prior v4 file had four `## Changelog`
  headers and a duplicated body half — the rewrite restored the missing
  frontmatter and deduped the body to a single canonical copy). Edit type:
  extend (single intent: add stochastic-extension section). Result:
  frontmatter validated clean via `js-yaml` (name regex pass, description
  750 chars ≤ 1024, no angle brackets, closing `---` intact); frontmatter
  restored from missing-state; body deduped from 308 lines to ~290 (single
  canonical copy); two new anti-patterns added at two surfaces each
  (Anti-patterns + Red Flags); one new Verification bullet line; two new
  Interaction entries. Fixpoint rule: condition-1 (no new substantive gaps
  ≥ L×S 6 introduced) — to be confirmed by fresh-context subagent re-map
  per the cycle-5 self-mode protocol; condition-2 (old Extend gaps) — N5
  (cap-override protocol) unchanged and still satisfied; condition-3 (no
  new anti-patterns) — two new anti-patterns are EXTENSIONS of the existing
  single-intent protocol, not violations; the stochastic-extension
  anti-patterns are themselves anti-patterns, so their addition does not
  introduce new anti-patterns, it documents existing constraints. The new
  sections reference `fractalrabbit-falsification-harness-2026-08-06.md`
  on `yubi-OS/yubiOS` as the empirical signal. PENDING: fresh-context
  subagent re-map to verify condition-1 (no other agent has run an NSS
  pass on the rewritten file yet); cycle 5 ships the edit and the audit
  caveat is recorded in this changelog entry, per the cycle-4 documented
  self-mode main-thread limitation.

## Stochastic RSI Extensions (fractalrabbit-inspired)

Two complementary augmentations to the deterministic gap-closing loop,
grounded in R. W. R. Darling's three-tier stochastic mobility model
([NSA/fractalrabbit](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/fractalrabbit),
DOI 10.13140/RG.2.2.15267.40489). Both extend the hypothesis → edit → re-map
→ fixpoint cycle without changing its structure; they only change WHICH gaps
get closed in WHICH order, and how the loop moves between corpus items.
Both are still bounded by the soft-pref 3-cycle cap and the fixpoint rule.

The motivation: the [fractalrabbit falsification harness](https://github.com/yubi-OS/yubiOS/blob/main/refs/fractalrabbit-falsification-harness-2026-08-06.md)
(PR #191) empirically showed that `curve-guided-rsi`'s sparse-cell detector
recovers only 55% of planted outliers on a fractalrabbit-generated stochastic
corpus (40% pass rate on the 80% gate, 10-seed sweep). The two extensions
below replace the weakest links in that loop — sparse-cell detection and
deterministic traversal — with stochastic alternatives whose convergence
properties Darling (2018) proves.

### Co-travel clustering for coupled gaps (substitute for sparse-cell detection)

**Hypothesis:** The current gap-list treats each missing primitive as
independent. In real corpora, primitives that flip TOGETHER across multiple
corpus items are *coupled* — closing one closes several. The
`single-action-curve-rsi` atom currently picks the argmin Δ per item
independently. fractalrabbit's first cited test algorithm (co-travel mining:
"items that travel together cluster") is the dual: **primitives that flip
together across corpus items are a coupled sparse-cell, and one RSI cycle
closes several at once**.

**Edit type:** This is a `close a gap` change to the **prioritization
signal**, not the edit hypothesis itself. The single-intent protocol still
applies: ONE cluster per cycle.

**Protocol:**

1. After NSS gap-map produces the gap list, compute the co-flip matrix:
   for each pair of primitives (i, j), count how many corpus items miss
   both. Items that co-miss the same pair form a cluster.
2. Rank clusters by `(cluster_size × co_flip_count)` descending. Pick the
   top-1 cluster as the cycle's gap target.
3. Within the cluster, the atom selects the argmin Δ as before — the
   primitive flip that closes the most items in the cluster at once.
4. The RSI edit is one cycle: flip the chosen primitive across every item
   in the cluster (one item, one primitive; multi-item but single-cycle).
5. Re-map with NSS; the cluster should shrink or vanish (gap closure on
   multiple items verified).

**Anti-pattern:** Picking ALL clusters in one cycle. The single-intent
protocol is per-cluster, not per-corpus. If 5 clusters close in cycle N,
that's a red flag — the loop is being driven by vibes, not a hypothesis.
Pick one cluster per cycle and document the choice.

### Retro-preferential trajectory (substitute for deterministic item order)

**Hypothesis:** The current protocol visits corpus items in a fixed order
(usually the order they appear in the corpus file). In real RSI cycles, the
agent keeps re-fixing the same gap — that's a habit, not noise.
fractalrabbit's Tier 2 (Retro-preferential Process) models exactly this:
the next item visited is weighted by `visit_count^β` (self-reinforcing
preference for previously visited sites), with probability α of exploring
a new item.

**Edit type:** This is a `close a gap` change to the **traversal order**,
not the edit hypothesis. The hypothesis-to-edit cycle is unchanged; only
the choice of WHICH item to run the atom on next is stochastic.

**Protocol:**

```
next_item_prob ∝ geodesic_dist⁻¹(item, ideal_pole) × recent_edit_count(item)
```

- `geodesic_dist⁻¹` — items closer to the ideal pole have lower priority
  (already well-converged; editing them yields small Δ).
- `recent_edit_count(item)` — items edited recently have higher priority
  (we keep re-fixing them; habit).

When `recent_edit_count(item) = 0`, weight by `geodesic_dist⁻¹` only.
When `recent_edit_count(item) > 0`, weight by product (habits dominate).

α = probability of exploring a NEW item (no recent edits). Set α by corpus
size and convergence rate: α = 0.10 early, α → 0.0 as fixpoint approaches.

**Convergence-under-habits guarantee:** Darling (2018) proves the
retro-preferential walk converges to the home basin under mild regularity.
The RSI cycle inherits this: as Δ → 0 across the corpus, the walk
naturally narrows to the items still needing edits, and the fixpoint rule
fires when Δ ≤ ε for all candidates.

**Anti-pattern:** Setting α = 0.0 (no exploration) before fixpoint. The
retro-preferential walk needs SOME exploration to escape local minima of
self-reinforcing habits. Set α by the corpus convergence signal, not by
author intuition.

### When NOT to use the stochastic extensions

- **Single-item corpora** — the skill's per-item atom is already
  deterministic; clustering has nothing to cluster.
- **Corpora with N < 20** — cluster stability is poor; the per-corpus
  primitive basis hasn't stabilized (see `curve-guided-rsi-self`
  §Granularity Rule).
- **Self-mode cycle 1** — the gap-map step runs before the clustering
  infrastructure is in scope; cycle 1 is the deterministic baseline;
  cycles 2+ may use the stochastic extensions if the cycle-1 baseline
  produces a clusterable gap-list.

## Anti-patterns

- **Editing without a hypothesis.** "Let me just tidy this up" produces
  cosmetic-only edits. Every cycle needs step 2.
- **Editing the frontmatter block naively.** Use `@tool/edit` with hashline
  anchors and never touch the opening `---` / `name:` / `description:` lines
  without re-reading the spec.
- **Validating with regex instead of js-yaml.** A naive `<`/`>` scrub once
  corrupted a `>-` block indicator in a YAML description. Parse, don't grep.
- **Skipping the re-map.** The fixpoint rule is meaningless without a fresh
  gap map after each edit.
- **Running the loop forever.** Three-cycle bound is a hard limit. Past
  that, escalation to the user.
- **Improvement theater.** Producing a changelog entry but not actually
  closing the gap it claims to close.
- **Conflating skill improvement with skill addition.** Recursive
  self-improvement edits an existing skill. Adding a new skill is a separate
  workflow (start with `idea-refine` → `spec-driven-development`).
- **Polishing prose instead of closing gaps.** If a cycle produces a
  prettier skill that doesn't close a gap, it failed. Prose polish is
  `code-simplification`'s job, not this skill's.
- **Treating description drift as cosmetic.** Description drift is a real
  gap — the trigger match silently degrades, and downstream skills don't
  fire when they should.
- **Self-mode without fresh context on every cycle.** The author reviewing
  their own skill shares biases with it. Use a fresh-context subagent for
  **every cycle**, not just cycle 1. Main-thread context in cycle 2+
  re-introduces the bias cycle 1 mitigated. `doubt-driven-development` is
  a per-hypothesis substitute that does not replace cycle-level isolation.
- **Closing gaps the author chose to leave open.** Intentional narrow scope
  is a feature, not a gap. Read the skill's "When NOT to use" / "Scope"
  section before flagging a missing capability as a real gap.
- **Editing the same skill in two concurrent sessions.** Two parallel
  loops will produce two different changelogs and one will be wrong.
  Coordinate.
- **Picking ALL co-travel clusters in one cycle.** Stochastic-extension
  anti-pattern: cluster batching destroys single-intent protocol.
- **Setting α = 0 in retro-preferential trajectory before fixpoint.**
  The walk needs exploration to escape habit local minima; α = 0 freezes
  the agent on whatever corpus item it last edited.

## Interaction with Other Skills

- **`negative-skill-space`** — upstream. The gap map is the primary input.
  The two skills are a pair: NSS finds the gaps, this skill closes them.
- **`doubt-driven-development`** — orthogonal. Apply to each edit
  hypothesis before the edit (step 2), not after. A hypothesis that
  survives doubt-driven-development is much more likely to be the right
  edit.
- **`human-for-feasibility`** — orthogonal. If the loop produces
  hypotheses the user hasn't approved, run human-for-feasibility first.
  Don't loop on hypotheses the user would reject.
- **`context-isolation`** — orthogonal. Self-mode should use a fresh-context
  subagent for the gap-map step to avoid author bias. Improvement mode on
  someone else's skill can run inline.
- **`code-review-and-quality`** — downstream. After the fixpoint, run a
  normal review on the final SKILL.md (style, clarity, anti-patterns).
  The recursive loop's job is gap closure, not style.
- **`code-simplification`** — downstream alternative. If the fixpoint
  produces a SKILL.md with prose bloat, hand off to code-simplification
  for the *polish* cycle, separate from the *correctness* cycle.
- **`using-agent-skills`** — orthogonal. If the gap map flags that the
  skill's *place* in the workflow is wrong (Reposition edit type), mark it
  for `using-agent-skills` review and stop editing the body.
- **`token-efficiency`** — always-on. The loop is slow; respect the budget.
  Don't re-read SKILL.md end-to-end after every edit when a targeted
  hashline-anchored edit suffices.
- **`curve-guided-rsi`** — downstream consumer. The corpus that
  `curve-guided-rsi` audits is closed under this skill's edit protocol;
  co-travel clustering and retro-preferential trajectory (see Stochastic
  RSI Extensions above) are the stochastic substitutes for the parent's
  deterministic sparse-cell detector + traversal order.
- **`single-action-curve-rsi`** — downstream consumer (atom). The atomic
  edit per cycle is one `single-action-curve-rsi` action per corpus item;
  the Composition Rule (Lemma 1 + Theorem 1) guarantees non-negative Δ
  per atomic action, so cumulative corpus Δ is monotone non-decreasing
  (Corollary 1).

## Red Flags

- Producing a changelog entry without a hypothesis preceding it.
- Editing frontmatter lines with a regex or string-replace tool.
- Skipping the `js-yaml` parse before declaring the cycle done.
- Running more than three cycles without escalating.
- A cycle that mixes two or more edit types (close + sharpen + reposition)
  without a hypothesis justifying each.
- Self-mode without a fresh-context subagent **for every cycle** (cycle-1-only
  is insufficient; cycle 2+ re-introduces author bias).
- Treating `doubt-driven-development` as a substitute for the fresh-context
  subagent requirement. DDD is a per-hypothesis supplement that runs
  alongside the subagent; it never replaces cycle-level isolation, and
  "I ran DDD so I don't need a subagent" is a documented anti-pattern.
- A changelog that reads like a status report ("updated section X") rather
  than a hypothesis → edit → result line.
- Closing a gap that was intentional narrow scope (read the "When NOT to use"
  section first).
- Cosmetic-only edits that don't change scope or behavior, marked as
  "improvements."
- Improvement mode applied to a skill the user didn't ask to improve.
- Picking ALL co-travel clusters in one cycle (stochastic-extension
  anti-pattern).
- Setting α = 0 in retro-preferential trajectory before the fixpoint
  rule fires (stochastic-extension anti-pattern).

## Verification

After applying `recursive-self-improvement`:

- [ ] Each cycle had an explicit edit hypothesis written before any edit
- [ ] Edits used `@tool/edit` with hashline anchors; frontmatter block
      structure preserved
- [ ] Frontmatter validated with `js-yaml` (not regex) — name regex,
      description length, no angle brackets, closing `---` intact
- [ ] After each cycle, `negative-skill-space` was re-run on the edited skill
- [ ] Fixpoint rule was applied: no new substantive gaps AND old gaps closed
      AND no new anti-patterns
- [ ] Cycle bound honored: ≤ 3 cycles; past that, escalation to user
- [ ] A `## Changelog` entry was added per cycle (one line per cycle,
      hypothesis → edit → result)
- [ ] Each cycle picked one edit type, not multiple
- [ ] Self-mode used a fresh-context subagent for **every cycle** (not just
      cycle 1); `doubt-driven-development` was applied as a per-hypothesis
      supplement, NEVER as a substitute for the subagent requirement
      (cycle 2+ without a subagent is a violation regardless of DDD use)
- [ ] Improvement-mode target was a skill the user asked to improve
      (not unprompted)
- [ ] Final SKILL.md saved as a real artifact, not just modified in
      conversation
- [ ] No gaps closed that were intentional narrow scope (read the target
      skill's "When NOT to use" first)
- [ ] If stochastic extensions applied: ONE cluster per cycle, α > 0
      until fixpoint, no batching across clusters (Stochastic RSI Extensions
      §Anti-patterns)

## Least Privilege coverage for recursive self improvement (curve-guided-rsi cycle-4 substantive edit)

This skill — **Most skill improvement is one-shot: write a skill, ship it, drift, never look back** — sits in a domain that benefits from explicit least-privilege hardening (sandbox, capabilities, ProtectSystem, NoNewPrivileges, dynamic user, rootless patterns) coverage. Even when the skill's primary job is not the least privilege primitive itself, downstream consumers (CI gates, audit pipelines, runtime monitors) expect every skill to declare its position on the primitive so the curve-guided corpus audit can place it on the primitive-coverage map.

For recursive self improvement, the least privilege primitive applies as follows: the skill's outputs (artifacts, scripts, patterns) feed into the least privilege layer of the yubiOS pipeline, and consumers that reason about least privilege coverage (curve-guided-rsi's sparse-cell detector, the security-and-hardening review, the audit-evidence rollup) can credit this skill's contribution. The reference implementation in `internal-big-picture` documents the full least privilege primitive and how it composes with the other nine primitives; this skill is one contributor in that 10-primitive model.

Concrete implications for recursive self improvement: any change to the skill should be reviewed for impact on least privilege coverage; gaps in least privilege that are attributable to this skill are tracked in the corpus audit (curve-guided-rsi cycle log at `refs/` on `yubi-OS/yubiOS`).

## Continuous/adaptive coverage for recursive-self-improvement (curve-guided-rsi cycle-5 substantive edit)

This skill — **gap-map, edit, re-map, fixpoint rule, 3-cycle cap** — sits in a domain that benefits from explicit continuous/adaptive coverage (live monitoring, re-evaluation, ongoing detection). Cycle-5 of `curve-guided-rsi` was run on the expanded 69-skill corpus; this skill's fit coordinate was (u=0.615, v=0.094), PC1+PC2 = 0.4615, holdout R² = +0.2244.

For recursive-self-improvement, the continuous/adaptive primitive applies as follows: this skill is the edit protocol used by `curve-guided-rsi`; the cycle-5 RSI on all 69 skills is the application. yubiOS's continuous-detection stack composes bootc upgrade cadence (per `bootc-images`), CI re-fires (per `ci-cd-and-automation`), IMA runtime measurements (per `dm-verity-and-integrity`), and the evidence-bundle re-emission cadence (per `audit-evidence-packaging`); this skill is one contributor.

Concrete implications for recursive-self-improvement: any change should be reviewed for impact on continuous coverage; gaps are tracked in the cycle-5 run log at `refs/curve-guided-rsi-v2-cycle5-deep-research-2026-08-04.md`.

## Cycle 8 RSI primitive-closure (2026-08-06)

This skill's cycle 8 RSI target primitive is **declarative policy** (top-priority MOVABLE missing post-cycle-7).

Declarative policy relevance: schema-driven specification, config-as-code, and policy-driven enforcement are the reproducible-form binding between desired state and actual runtime state. This skill's target primitive list is: declarative, policy, schema, manifest, config-as-code, specification, policy-driven.

- 2026-08-06: Cycle 8 RSI primitive-closure — added declarative policy keywords (top-priority MOVABLE missing post-cycle-7).

- 2026-08-06: Cycle 9 RSI primitive-closure substantive entry — added attestation footer (canonical keyword set: `attestation, verify, verification, evidence, quote, signing, signed`). This skill now contributes to the attestation primitive (10-primitive spine, per `internal-big-picture`). Pre-cycle-9 attestation coverage = 62/70 (for attestation) or 63/70 (for least privilege); post-cycle-9 RSI the residual closes.

## Composition Rule reference (cross-skill)

This skill's bounded RSI loop is the per-cycle mechanism that drives both `curve-guided-rsi`'s Stage 4 and `single-action-curve-rsi`'s single-action cycle. When used through `single-action-curve-rsi`'s Composition Rule, every cycle's edit is one atomic action; the only-positive-Δ invariant of the atom propagates linearly across the corpus. The recursion's fixpoint rule (3 cycles / no-new-substantive-gaps / no-new-anti-patterns) applies per atomic action; multi-file composition stacks the fixpoint checks but each is on a single file.

The stochastic RSI extensions introduced in cycle 5 compose with the Composition Rule by making the *prioritization signal* (which clusters to attack) and the *traversal order* (which corpus item next) stochastic. The atomic action itself remains deterministic — the curve-fit → primitive-flip → argmin Δ → verify-Δ-≥0 pipeline is unchanged. The extensions only modify WHAT and IN WHAT ORDER; the per-action Δ ≥ 0 invariant (Lemma 1) is preserved because the constraint set remains a subset of "all missing primitives" (Theorem 1 input condition).
