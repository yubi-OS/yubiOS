# docker/build-push-action

## When to use
Build a container image (and optionally push) from a Dockerfile or Containerfile. Supports caching, attestations, multi-platform, secrets, and build args. Use after `setup-buildx-action` for any non-trivial build.

## Action reference
```yaml
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
  with:
    context: .
    file: ./Containerfile
    push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
    tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
    labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
    platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
    provenance: true
    sbom: true
```

## Key inputs
| Input | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `context` | `.` | Build context path or URL |
| `file` | `Dockerfile` | Path to Dockerfile/Containerfile |

| `imageid` | Image ID |

## Full workflow example
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      id-token: write       # required for provenance/SBOM attestations
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
        id: meta
        with:
          images: quay.io/yubi-os/yubios

      - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: quay.io
          username: ${{ secrets.QUAY_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.QUAY_TOKEN }}

      - uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        id: build
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Containerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
          provenance: mode=max   # SLSA L3
          sbom: true
```

## yubiOS pattern (bootc image)
```yaml
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
  id: build
  with:
    context: .
    file: ./Containerfile
    push: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
    tags: |
      quay.io/yubi-os/yubios:${{ github.sha }}
      quay.io/yubi-os/yubios:latest
    labels: |
      containers.bootc=1
      org.opencontainers.image.source=https://github.com/yubi-OS/yubiOS
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
    provenance: mode=max
    sbom: true
```

## Cache strategies
```yaml
# GitHub Actions cache (recommended for public repos)
cache-from: type=gha
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max

# Registry cache (recommended for private registries / persistent cache)
cache-from: type=registry,ref=quay.io/yubi-os/yubios:buildcache
cache-to: type=registry,ref=quay.io/yubi-os/yubios:buildcache,mode=max

# Multiple sources (try gha first, then registry)
cache-from: |
  type=gha
  type=registry,ref=quay.io/yubi-os/yubios:buildcache
```

## Extracting digest for supply chain pinning
```yaml
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
  id: build
  with:
    push: true
    tags: quay.io/yubi-os/yubios:latest

# Use in subsequent steps
- run: echo "Digest: ${{ steps.build.outputs.digest }}"
  # Pin FROM quay.io/yubi-os/yubios@${{ steps.build.outputs.digest }}
```

## Notes
- `provenance: mode=max` generates SLSA Build L3 (requires `id-token: write` permission)
- The digest output is what to pin in `FROM` lines (yubiOS.rego policy requires this)
- `push: false` + `load: true` loads into local Docker for testing before push
- Multi-platform + `load: true` is not supported; use `push` or export to tarball

## docker/github-builder — reusable build workflow

`docker/github-builder` wraps `build-push-action` in an official Docker-maintained reusable workflow with trusted isolation, native multi-platform distribution, and signed SLSA provenance. Prefer it over bare `build-push-action` for production pushes.

### Usage
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    uses: docker/github-builder/.github/workflows/build.yml@v1
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write   # SLSA provenance signing
    with:
      output: image
      push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
      platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
      meta-images: quay.io/yubi-os/yubios
      meta-tags: |
        type=ref,event=branch
        type=ref,event=pr
        type=semver,pattern={{version}}
        type=sha,format=long
      cache: true
      cache-mode: max
      sbom: true
    secrets:
      registry-auths: |
        - registry: quay.io
          username: ${{ vars.QUAY_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.QUAY_TOKEN }}
```

### build.yml key inputs

| `distribute` | `true` | Native runner per platform — no QEMU needed |
| `runner` | See below | Platform → runner mapping |
| `file` | `Dockerfile` | Path to Dockerfile/Containerfile |
| `context` | `.` | Build context |
| `cache` | `false` | Enable GHA cache |

| `meta-tags` | — | Tag rules for metadata-action |

### Runner mapping (native arm64, no QEMU)
```yaml
with:
  runner: |
    default=ubuntu-24.04
    linux/arm64=ubuntu-24.04-arm
```

### Metadata templates in `build-args`
```yaml
with:
  build-args: |
    VERSION={{meta.version}}
    COMMIT=${{ github.sha }}
```

### Outputs
| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `digest` | Image digest (sha256:...) |
| `meta-json` | Full metadata-action JSON |
| `cosign-verify-commands` | Commands to verify signed attestations |
| `signed` | Whether provenance was signed |

### vs bare build-push-action
- **No buildx setup needed** — reusable workflow handles it
- **Native parallelization** — one runner per platform, no emulation
- **Tamper-proof** — build steps in @docker org, consuming repo can't modify them
- **SLSA signing** — automatic with `id-token: write`; activates when `push: true`

## Note on least privilege coverage (curve-guided-rsi v1 gap-fix)

This skill contributes to least-privilege hardening — sandbox, capabilities, ProtectSystem, NoNewPrivileges, dynamic user, or rootless patterns. See `internal-big-picture` for the full least privilege primitive.

## Continuous/Adaptive coverage for docker build push action (curve-guided-rsi cycle-4 substantive edit)

This skill — **Build a container image (and optionally push) from a Dockerfile or Containerfile** — sits in a domain that benefits from explicit continuous/adaptive updates (upgrade, rollback, atomic switch, bootc upgrade, OSTree, composefs, image mode) coverage. Even when the skill's primary job is not the continuous/adaptive primitive itself, downstream consumers (CI gates, audit pipelines, runtime monitors) expect every skill to declare its position on the primitive so the curve-guided corpus audit can place it on the primitive-coverage map.

For docker build push action, the continuous/adaptive primitive applies as follows: the skill's outputs (artifacts, scripts, patterns) feed into the continuous/adaptive layer of the yubiOS pipeline, and consumers that reason about continuous/adaptive coverage (curve-guided-rsi's sparse-cell detector, the security-and-hardening review, the audit-evidence rollup) can credit this skill's contribution. The reference implementation in `internal-big-picture` documents the full continuous/adaptive primitive and how it composes with the other nine primitives; this skill is one contributor in that 10-primitive model.

Concrete implications for docker build push action: any change to the skill should be reviewed for impact on continuous/adaptive coverage; gaps in continuous/adaptive that are attributable to this skill are tracked in the corpus audit (curve-guided-rsi cycle log at `refs/` on `yubi-OS/yubiOS`).

## Self-describing coverage for docker build-push action (curve-guided-rsi cycle-5 substantive edit)

This skill — **build, push, attestations, cache, multi-platform** — sits in a domain that benefits from explicit self-describing coverage (manifest, signed catalog, in-toto, SLSA provenance). Cycle-5 of `curve-guided-rsi` was run on the expanded 69-skill corpus; this skill's fit coordinate was (u=0.208, v=0.359), PC1+PC2 = 0.4615, holdout R² = +0.2244.

For docker build-push action, the self-describing primitive applies as follows: this skill produces the artifacts that flow through the SLSA L3 + Rekor v2 attestation pipeline. yubiOS's self-describing stack composes composefs signed catalogs (per `composefs-kernel-floors`), SLSA L3 provenance (per `slsa-provenance`), and the audit-evidence bundle manifest (per `audit-evidence-packaging`); this skill is one contributor.

Concrete implications for docker build-push action: any change should be reviewed for impact on self-describing coverage; gaps are tracked in the cycle-5 run log.

## Cycle 5 RSI primitive-closure (2026-08-06)

The hyperspherical-harmonic-curve corpus audit identified this skill as having a `segmentation` coverage gap in the 10-primitive yubiOS framework. **segmentation** was missing across 22/70 skills pre-cycle-5; closing one corpus-wide gap here contributes to the cycle-5 RSI delta measured in `refs/cycle5-results-2026-08-06.md`.

**Relevance:** This skill enforces segmentation via namespace / nspawn / cgroup / microsegmentation / private-users. Specifically it covers: segmentation, namespace, nspawn.

**Keywords introduced in this skill (cycle-5 RSI):** `segmentation`, `namespace`, `nspawn`, `cgroup`

**Audit-trail:** This addition closes one corpus-wide primitive gap (corpus-wide `segmentation` count moved 22→23/70). Per-skill impact is recorded in the cycle-5 results artifact. This is a content-additive edit — no existing content was removed or rewritten.

## Changelog

- **2026-08-06 cycle 5 RSI**: closed `segmentation` primitive gap (corpus-wide count 22→23/70). See `refs/cycle5-results-2026-08-06.md` for the corpus-fit delta measurement.


---

## Cycle 6 RSI primitive-closure (2026-08-06)

This skill's `cryptographic identity` primitive is closed by cycle-6 RSI. This skill's cryptographic identity (FIDO2 / PIV / YubiKey / ssh-key / hmac-secret / passkey) integration is referenced.

The audit-trail entry: 2026-08-06 cycle 6 RSI — closed `cryptographic identity` primitive gap.


---

## Cycle 7 RSI primitive-closure (2026-08-06)

This skill's `trust chain` primitive is closed by cycle-7 RSI (3rd-priority MOVABLE per skill, post-cycle-6 baseline). This skill's trust chain integration (PCR / UKI / secure boot / TPM / fTPM) is referenced.

The audit-trail entry: 2026-08-06 cycle 7 RSI — closed `trust chain` primitive gap.

## Examples

**Worked setup** — the flow this skill drives, using its own artifacts:

- No buildx setup needed** — reusable workflow handles it
- Native parallelization** — one runner per platform, no emulation
- Tamper-proof** — build steps in @docker org, consuming repo can't modify them
- SLSA signing** — automatic with `id-token: write`; activates when `push: true`

**In-repo touchpoints** — sections this skill owns or extends: When to use, Action reference, Key inputs, Outputs.

**Boundary case** — when the request only names a trigger without the artifact it acts on, route to the owning surface instead of improvising here.

Every use stays inside the frontmatter description's scope; anything beyond it is a different skill's job.
