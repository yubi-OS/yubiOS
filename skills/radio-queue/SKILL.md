# Radio Queue on rock1

On-device YouTube → PCM → ALSA playlist with a **prequeue worker** that downloads + transcodes the next track while the current one plays — eliminates the gap between songs. Append URLs to `queue.txt`, daemon takes care of the rest, no per-song bridge round-trip needed.

This is a higher-level variant of [`play-audio-on-rock1`](../play-audio-on-rock1/SKILL.md). That skill covers single-clip generation + transfer + playback; this skill assumes the parent is deployed (player + set_mixer.py at `/tmp/audio/`) and adds on-device downloads + a queue loop with prequeueing on top.

## Why this exists

The parent skill ferries raw PCM over Tailscale Funnel as base64 chunks. Fine for one clip; terrible for a playlist — every song is a dozen bridge calls before playback even starts. Moving downloads to the device means the bridge is only used to *seed* the queue and *observe* it; each song is then a local operation (yt-dlp + ffmpeg + play2.py) with no Funnel round-trip.

The first version of this skill did downloads + transcodes *sequentially* per song, which left a ~5–15 s gap between tracks while yt-dlp fetched and ffmpeg converted. The **prequeue** worker closes that gap by overlapping the next track's download with the current track's playback — in steady state there's no audible pause at all.

The user's voice that drove this: *"is the download happening on device or on your end? make sure its on device so we can just queue a playlist"*, followed up after seeing the gap: *"add a prequeue for the download itself so theres no pause between tracks"*.

## Architecture

```
/tmp/audio/queue/
├── queue.txt          # playlist — one URL per line, append anytime
├── queue_player.sh    # daemon (one process) + spawned prequeue workers
├── queue.log          # rolling log (also tee'd to /dev/ttyS2)
├── queue.out          # daemon stdout (normally empty)
├── prequeue.lock      # PID of in-flight prequeue worker (absent when idle)
├── prequeue.out       # prequeue worker stdout (debug only)
├── current.webm       # yt-dlp's intermediate download for the playing track
├── current.mp3        # ffmpeg extraction for the playing track
├── current.pcm        # ffmpeg's PCM output for play2.py (playing track)
├── next.webm          # pre-downloaded intermediate for the NEXT track
├── next.mp3           # pre-extracted mp3 for the NEXT track
└── next.pcm           # pre-transcoded PCM, ready to swap in
```

Two parallel pipelines share the disk:

**Foreground (current.\*)** — the track that is playing right now.
**Background (next.\*)** — the track the prequeue worker is preparing while the foreground plays.

Per song the daemon does three phases:

1. **Ensure `current.pcm` is ready** — if `next.pcm` exists (worker finished during the previous track), atomically swap `next.*` → `current.*` (instant). Otherwise cold-download + transcode.
2. **Launch the prequeue worker** for the next URL in `queue.txt` — only if no worker is already running (guarded by `prequeue.lock`). The worker writes `next.webm`, `next.mp3`, `next.pcm` in sequence, then removes the lock.
3. **Play `current.pcm`** via `play2.py`, then `rm current.*`. The worker keeps churning on `next.*` — they don't collide.

Per-track pipeline (runs in foreground for `current.*`, in background for `next.*`):

1. `yt-dlp --no-check-certificates -f bestaudio -x --audio-format mp3` → `{current,next}.{webm,mp3}`
2. `ffmpeg -i ….{webm,mp3} -ar 44100 -ac 2 -f s16le ….{pcm}` — **stereo, 44.1 kHz (CD quality)**
3. `sudo -n python3 /tmp/audio/set_mixer.py` — force-on mixer (idempotent, ~1s) — foreground only, before every song
4. `sudo -n python3 /tmp/audio/play2.py current.pcm --device hw:1,0 --rate 44100 --in-channels 2` — foreground only
5. `rm current.*` — foreground only; `next.*` is owned by the prequeue worker

The prequeue keeps the *download* phase out of the playback-critical path. Since downloads almost always finish before the playing track ends, the swap in step 1 is instant and the next track starts seamlessly. The only audible gap is the cold-start first song, or the rare case where prequeue download > playback duration (e.g. a very short clip followed by a slow network).

## Quick start (one-shot deploy)

```bash
# 1. Push install.sh + queue_player.sh + queue.sh to rock1 (base64 push, single call)
# 2. Run install.sh on rock1 — installs ffmpeg + yt-dlp + creates /tmp/audio/queue/
# 3. Start the daemon in background (nohup, returns immediately)
# 4. Append your first URL to queue.txt
```

The `scripts/install.sh` handles steps 1-2 idempotently. Push it from Sauna via the bridge:

```bash
# On Sauna side
base64 scripts/install.sh | xargs -I{} curl -X POST "$BRIDGE/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"command":["bash","-c","printf %s {} | base64 -d > /tmp/install.sh && sudo -n bash /tmp/install.sh"]}'
```

Then start the daemon and queue your first song:

```bash
# Start daemon (returns immediately, detached via nohup)
curl -X POST "$BRIDGE/run" -d '{"command":["bash","-c",
  "nohup /tmp/audio/queue/queue_player.sh </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 & echo detached pid=$!"]}'

# Append the first URL
curl -X POST "$BRIDGE/run" -d '{"command":["bash","-c",
  "echo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ >> /tmp/audio/queue/queue.txt"]}'
```

## Recipes

### Append a song while the daemon is playing

```bash
# On Sauna side (one bridge call)
curl -X POST "$BRIDGE/run" -d '{"command":["bash","-c",
  "echo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID >> /tmp/audio/queue/queue.txt"]}'

# On rock1 directly (faster — no bridge)
echo 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID' >> /tmp/audio/queue/queue.txt
```

### Append with a clip (skip intro, trim to a section)

Per-line pipe-separated args:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID|start=30|duration=120
```

- `start=N` — skip the first N seconds
- `duration=M` — play only M seconds (requires `start`)

Without args, the full song plays. The same arg format is honored by both the foreground download and the prequeue worker.

### Verify a URL before queueing

yt-dlp's `ERROR: [youtube] <id>: Video unavailable` means the URL is wrong, the video was removed, or it's region-locked. Bad IDs burn a queue slot, pollute queue.log, and force the next URL through a cold download. Probe URLs before queuing — `--skip-download` + `--dump-single-json` is cheap (no audio fetched):

```bash
# On rock1, via the bridge
curl -X POST "$BRIDGE/run" -d '{"command":["bash","-c","yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --skip-download --dump-single-json \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\" 2>&1"]}'

# On rock1 directly (faster, no bridge)
yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --skip-download --dump-single-json 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID'
```

A verified URL returns a JSON blob containing `"title"` + `"id"` fields. An unverified one returns the `Video unavailable` error. The shipped `scripts/examples/playlist-upbeat-verified.md` is fully verified; `scripts/examples/playlist-classic-rock.md` had one wrong ID (Don't Stop Me Now — `HgzGwKwLmgQ` instead of `HgzGwKwLmgM`) — fixed 2026-08-05 with a comment annotation. For new playlists, run each URL through the probe first; only queue the ones that resolve.

Why this matters: the daemon's "errors don't kill the daemon" anti-pattern is good for resilience but doesn't keep the queue log clean. A bad URL consumes a slot (consumed = removed from queue.txt), pollutes queue.log with the failure, and forces the next URL through a cold download. Pre-verification saves ~30-60s per bad URL.

### List / inspect / clear the queue

Use the `scripts/queue.sh` helper (push it to rock1 first):

```bash
queue.sh list       # cat queue.txt
queue.sh status     # queue + current playback + prequeue state + last log lines
queue.sh clear      # empty queue.txt (kills any running prequeue worker)
queue.sh skip       # kill current play2.py (next song starts immediately)
queue.sh stop       # kill the daemon + any prequeue worker
queue.sh add URL    # append a URL
```

`queue.sh status` shows whether a prequeue worker is in flight (its PID from `prequeue.lock`) and whether `next.pcm` is already prepared — useful for diagnosing "why is the gap longer than usual?".

### Force mixer @ 100% mid-playback

The daemon already does this before every song. If you want it *now* (e.g. after a manual mixer reset):

```bash
sudo -n python3 /tmp/audio/set_mixer.py
```

### Stream the live log over the bridge

```bash
tail -F /tmp/audio/queue/queue.log | tee -a /dev/ttyS2
```

`PREQUEUE: …` lines in the log mark when the worker starts, finishes, fails, or swaps into `current`.


### Stop everything cleanly (before a fresh queue push, before reboot, etc.)

`queue.sh stop` kills the daemon + the in-flight prequeue worker, but does NOT reliably kill `play2.py`. `play2.py` runs as **root** via `sudo -n python3` wrapper, so the bridge user `shant` cannot signal it directly — `kill -9` from the bridge fails with "Operation not permitted", and the music keeps playing even though `queue.sh stop` "succeeded". Hard-stop sequence:

```bash
# 1. queue.sh stop (kills queue_player.sh + prequeue worker; signals play2.py via SIGTERM)
sudo -n /tmp/audio/queue/queue.sh stop

# 2. Wait for SIGTERM to propagate, then verify (do NOT trust kill -0 — see anti-pattern below)
sleep 2

# 3. sudo walk /proc to find any surviving play2.py PIDs
#    (do NOT use pkill -f play2.py — the bash command line itself contains "play2.py"
#     and pkill would self-match and SIGKILL the cleanup script)
sudo -n sh -c 'for p in /proc/[0-9]*; do grep -q play2.py "$p/cmdline" 2>/dev/null && echo "STILL: $(tr \"\0\" \" \" < $p/cmdline)"; done'

# 4. sudo kill -9 each surviving PID by exact PID
for pid in $(sudo -n sh -c 'ls /proc | grep -E "^[0-9]+$" | while read p; do grep -q play2.py /proc/$p/cmdline 2>/dev/null && echo $p; done'); do
  echo killing $pid; sudo -n kill -9 "$pid"
done

# 5. Verify ALSA device is free (fuser without sudo can be wrong)
sudo -n fuser /dev/snd/pcmC1D0p 2>&1 || echo "device free"

# 6. Cleanup scratch
sudo -n rm -f /tmp/audio/queue/current.* /tmp/audio/queue/next.* \
  /tmp/audio/queue/prequeue.lock /tmp/audio/queue/prequeue.out
```

**Why this matters:** without sudo + /proc walk, a "stopped everything" report can be wrong — the daemon dies, the verification grep returns nothing, but `play2.py` is still alive and pumping audio to `hw:1,0`. The user hears music keep playing. The 2026-08-05 SAMPLMAN-set stop demonstrated this twice in a row before the sudo walk caught the surviving `play2.py` (PID 17180) by walking `/proc` with sudo permissions.

## Quirks

- **Prequeue eliminates pause between tracks** — in steady state (queue has ≥2 entries), the next track is downloaded + transcoded while the current one plays. The atomic `next.*` → `current.*` swap on track boundary is instant. The cold-start first song still pays the download cost (or any time the prequeue falls behind, e.g. very short clips on slow networks).
- **One prequeue worker at a time** — `prequeue.lock` is the guard. The daemon only kicks off a new worker if no lock is present, and the worker removes its lock on exit (success or failure). If you want overlap, you'd need separate `next2.*` slots and more daemon logic — not built in.
- **Prequeue failures fall back to cold download** — if `yt-dlp` or `ffmpeg` fails inside the worker, it removes `next.*` cleanly and logs `PREQUEUE: failed`. The next track iteration of the daemon will cold-download the URL when its turn comes. No infinite loops.
- **`queue.sh clear` kills the prequeue** — empty the queue mid-cycle and any running worker is also `kill`ed, with `next.*` cleaned up. Otherwise the worker would keep churning on a song that's about to be discarded.
- **Volume always locked at 100%** — the daemon re-runs `set_mixer.py` before every song. The ES8316 mixer state is in-memory and resets on reboot; without this step the next song can play at low volume or be muted. This is the user-driven design choice after the parent skill was used standalone and produced low-volume output.
- **Bot detection on YouTube** — `yt-dlp` can hit "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" on some videos. Workarounds in order of intrusiveness: (1) `--extractor-args "youtube:player_client=mediaconnect"` — newer player clients avoid some detection; (2) `--cookies-from-browser firefox` — needs a browser profile on rock1 (not in this skill); (3) `--cookies /tmp/cookies.txt` — export cookies from a desktop browser first. The `--no-check-certificates` flag the daemon uses is unrelated to this; it just handles sandbox-style cert-chain issues on some networks.
- **The yt-dlp source distribution's shebang** — the GitHub `yt-dlp` URL ships a Python zipapp that needs Python 3.10+. `install.sh` rewrites the shebang to whatever `which python3` resolves to (on rock1 that's Python 3.14 — works fine). If you want zero-dependency, download `yt-dlp_aarch64` (the PyInstaller standalone binary) instead — `install.sh` can be edited to swap the URL.
- **5-second idle when queue runs dry** — when `queue.txt` is empty and there's no `next.pcm` to swap in, the daemon sleeps 5s before re-checking. If you append during that window, the song starts on the next poll (worst case 5s latency). For real-time responsiveness, drop the sleep to 1s.
- **One song at a time** — `hw:1,0` is exclusive; the daemon kills no one because nothing else is playing. If you want to interleave with other audio sources, run them on a separate ALSA device or mix them upstream.
- **`sudo -n` is mandatory** — `install.sh` and the daemon call `sudo -n python3 ...` and `sudo -n ffmpeg`; the user must already be in NOPASSWD sudoers. On rock1 this is set for `shant`.
- **Log truncation** — `queue.log` auto-truncates to its last half when it crosses 200 KB. The full history is not preserved; tail it externally if you need it.
- **Errors don't kill the daemon** — if yt-dlp or ffmpeg fails for one song (foreground or prequeue worker), the daemon logs it and moves on to the next. Failed URLs stay consumed (removed from `queue.txt`) so they don't loop forever.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't run yt-dlp on Sauna + transfer PCM chunks** — that's the slow path. The whole point of this skill is to keep downloads on-device. Use this skill or extend it; don't bolt yt-dlp onto the parent's chunked-transfer path.
- **Don't `kill -9` the daemon without first killing any in-flight `play2.py` or prequeue worker** — the play2.py will keep holding `/dev/snd` until it naturally closes; the prequeue worker will keep downloading into `next.*`. Use `queue.sh stop` to handle both cleanly.
- **Don't write to `current.*` or `next.*` while the daemon is running** — both paths are scratch files owned by the daemon + prequeue worker. Race conditions are possible.
- **Don't apt install `alsa-utils`** — the parent skill explicitly avoids this to keep the rock1 box clean. We *do* apt-install `ffmpeg` here because there's no stdlib alternative for audio decoding; that's the one trade-off.
- **Don't run the daemon twice** — it will compete for `hw:1,0`. Use `pgrep -af queue_player.sh` to check before starting, or `queue.sh status`.
- **Don't disable the prequeue to "simplify"** — the gap between tracks was the user's most-noticed friction with the v1 design. If you fork this skill, keep the prequeue worker.
- **Don't queue URLs without verifying them first** — the daemon's "errors don't kill the daemon" rule prevents infinite loops, but it doesn't keep the queue log clean. A bad ID (video removed, region-locked, or simply wrong) burns a download slot, pollutes queue.log with `ERROR: [youtube] <id>: Video unavailable`, and forces the next URL through a cold download. Run `yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --skip-download --dump-single-json URL` on rock1 first; only queue URLs that return a JSON blob with the expected title + id.

## Pairs with

- [`play-audio-on-rock1`](../play-audio-on-rock1/SKILL.md) — parent skill. Provides `play2.py` and `set_mixer.py` at `/tmp/audio/`. This skill *requires* those files; deploy the parent first.
- [`debug-with-cli`](../debug-with-cli/SKILL.md) — the shell bridge pattern. This skill uses the bridge to *seed* the queue but never for per-song data transfer.
- `ascii-uart-animator` — same `/dev/ttyS2` banner tee pattern; this skill tees its log lines there so you can watch downloads + playbacks on a serial console.

## Examples

**Worked setup** — the flow this skill drives, using its own artifacts:

- Ensure `current.pcm` is ready** — if `next.pcm` exists (worker finished during the previous track), atomically swap `next.*` → `current.*` (instant). Otherwise cold-download + transcode.
- Launch the prequeue worker** for the next URL in `queue.txt` — only if no worker is already running (guarded by `prequeue.lock`). The worker writes `next.webm`, `next.mp3`, `next.pcm` in sequence, then removes the lock.
- Play `current.pcm`** via `play2.py`, then `rm current.*`. The worker keeps churning on `next.*` — they don't collide.
- Prequeue eliminates pause between tracks** — in steady state (queue has ≥2 entries), the next track is downloaded + transcoded while the current one plays. The atomic `next.*` → `current.*` swap on track boundary is instant. The cold-start first song still pays the download cost (or any time the prequeue falls behind, e.g. very short clips on slow networks).

**In-repo touchpoints** — sections this skill owns or extends: Why this exists, Architecture, Quick start (one-shot deploy), Recipes.

**Boundary case** — when the request only names a trigger without the artifact it acts on, route to the owning surface instead of improvising here.
