# Verified Jacob Collier playlist

All six YouTube IDs in this file were verified via `yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --skip-download --dump-single-json <url>` on rock1 on 2026-08-05 — every URL resolved to its claimed title with the correct ID.

This is the curator-selected set of Jacob Collier's top performances for the radio-queue skill. The selection spans studio recordings (Hideaway, Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing), live orchestral improvisations (Kennedy Center / National Symphony, BBC Proms / Metropole Orkest), and high-profile collaborations (Coldplay's Chris Martin on Fix You, Alita Moses on Dancing Queen, John Legend + Tori Kelly on Bridge Over Troubled Water). All videos are official-channel uploads.

## How these IDs were verified

Same recipe as `playlist-upbeat-verified.md`: probe with `yt-dlp --skip-download --dump-single-json` before queueing. Verified URLs return a JSON blob containing `title` + `id`; bad IDs return `ERROR: [youtube] <id>: Video unavailable`.

```bash
# On rock1, via the bridge
yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --skip-download --dump-single-json 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID' 2>&1
```

## Why these performances

Jacob Collier's signature is multi-tracked vocal/instrumental arrangement + cross-genre collaboration. The selection above covers three modes: (a) **studio solo** (Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing, Hideaway, Little Blue) — Collier playing every part himself, recorded at home; (b) **orchestral live** (Real Early Morning with Metropole Orkest at BBC Proms) — Collier improvising with an 80-piece ensemble; (c) **high-profile collaborations** (Dancing Queen with Alita Moses, Fix You with Chris Martin) — Collier's vocal harmonizing style in a duet/featured-artist context.

Curator's note: this is a 6-song sample. For a longer playlist, add his Djesse Vol. 1–4 tracks (Nightingale, With The Love In My Heart, It Don't Matter, etc.) — all on his official YouTube channel. The Kennedy Center improvisation with the National Symphony Orchestra (`TURkB9zqxa0`, 12.8M views) is also worth queueing if you want a longer-form single (it's a ~10 min improvisation).

## Verification history

- 2026-08-05 — initial verification + queue trigger; all 6 IDs returned correct titles + ids via `--dump-single-json`; daemon transitioned from the upbeat playlist to this Jacob Collier set on rock1 end-to-end (queue.txt overwritten via base64 push).
