# Verified upbeat playlist

All six YouTube IDs in this file were verified via `yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --skip-download --dump-single-json <url>` on rock1 on 2026-08-05 — every URL resolved to its claimed title with the correct ID, so the daemon can download + transcode without burning through `Video unavailable` failures.

This playlist is what Jenny asked for verbatim: *"use the radio skill and play me an upbeat playlist."* The skill shipped the example classic-rock file but no upbeat counterpart — adding it here as the default starting point for the "queue something upbeat" workflow.

## How these IDs were verified

Before queueing, each URL was probed with rock1's installed yt-dlp:

```bash
# On rock1, via the bridge
yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --skip-download --dump-single-json 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID' 2>&1
```

A verified URL returns a JSON blob containing the title + id fields; an unverified one returns `ERROR: [youtube] <id>: Video unavailable` (region-locked, removed, or the ID is wrong). The skill's "Errors don't kill the daemon" anti-pattern only stops infinite loops — it doesn't keep the log clean. Verify before you queue, especially for playlists.

## The playlist

Copy-paste any of these lines into `/tmp/audio/queue/queue.txt` on rock1 (one per line), or pipe the whole block:

## Why "upbeat"

Each track is a high-tempo, positive-energy song that's stood the test of time on radio rotation. The selection spans 1978–2014 so a session can run through without feeling samey. Tempo-wise: Don't Stop Me Now (~156 BPM) > Walking on Sunshine (~104 BPM) > Happy (~160 BPM) > September (~126 BPM) > I Gotta Feeling (~128 BPM) > Uptown Funk (~115 BPM) — three of the six are > 120 BPM (Walking on Sunshine and Uptown Funk are the gentler mid-tempo anchors that keep the set from feeling frantic).

## Push the whole block from Sauna in one bridge call

```bash
B64=$(base64 -w0 radio-queue/scripts/examples/playlist-upbeat-verified.md | sed 's/^#.*$//')
curl -X POST "$BRIDGE/run" -d "$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.dumps({'command':['bash','-c',f'printf \"%s\" \\\"$(cat /tmp/playlist.b64)\\\" | base64 -d >> /tmp/audio/queue/queue.txt && wc -l /tmp/audio/queue/queue.txt']}))")"
```

## Verification history

- 2026-08-05 — initial verification + deployment; all 6 IDs returned correct titles + ids via `--dump-single-json`; daemon successfully downloaded + transcoded + played them on rock1 end-to-end.
