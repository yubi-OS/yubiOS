# SAMPLMAN - Topic — full channel dump (all 65 videos)

All 65 YouTube IDs from the **SAMPLMAN - Topic** YouTube channel (channel ID `UCcxS3mHY3ITjmLv5M00lCpQ`). Enumerated via `yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --flat-playlist --print id --print title --print duration --print url` on rock1 on 2026-08-05; all 65 verified accessible via `yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --skip-download --print title --print id --print duration`.

This is the **full-channel dump** archetype — every upload from a single channel, no curation. Distinct from the other example playlists (`playlist-classic-rock.md` / `playlist-upbeat-verified.md` / `playlist-jacob-collier.md` / `playlist-lofi-verified.md`) which are hand-picked by genre/mood. Use this archetype when you want to ingest a whole artist's catalog in one shot.

**Total runtime:** 157m 27s across 65 tracks. Track durations range from 50s to 5m 44s. Two long-running numbered series — "ITS A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR A DAY" (15 tracks: ONE through THRTN) and "SEETHROUGH" (11 tracks: 2 through 12) — account for 26 of the 65 uploads.

## Verification status

All 65 videos verified 2026-08-05 on rock1 via `yt-dlp --skip-download`. Zero failures, zero "Video unavailable" errors, zero "live stream recording is not available" (the failure mode that bit the Lofi Girl 24/7 livestream IDs in `playlist-lofi-verified.md`).

## Channel signature

SAMPLMAN's uploads cluster into three groupings:

- **"ITS A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR A DAY" series** — 15 tracks numbered ONE through THRTN (THIRTEEN). Same song pattern across multiple durations/versions.
- **"SEETHROUGH" series** — 11 tracks numbered 2 through 12. Another long-running series.
- **Standalone cuts** — ALL CAPS titles with periods-as-words ("NEVER.COULD.I.LEAVE.U", "AND.I.WANT.IT.RARE", "POW.HER.PUFF", "FUCKING.SUNDAY"), plus shorter lowercase titles ("jonnyquest", "egos", "be honest", "for my heart").

The aesthetic reads as lo-fi hip-hop / sampled beats / dub production with a heavy stylistic identity. Album-style grouping (15-track series + 11-track series + many standalone cuts) suggests these are EPs rather than scattered singles.

## NOT triggered on rock1

Per the user's explicit directive ("dont start this yet"), this file exists as a permanent example only — the daemon on rock1 is NOT playing these tracks. To queue it later, use the radio-queue skill's standard "Append while the daemon plays" recipe:

```bash
# Verify a sample first (the recipe in SKILL.md)
curl -X POST "$BRIDGE/run" -d '{"command":["bash","-c","yt-dlp --no-check-certificates --skip-download --print title --print id --print duration "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zSZToj9qdc""]}'

# Then append the whole playlist (or pipe from this file via base64 push)
B64=$(base64 -w0 radio-queue/scripts/examples/playlist-samplman.md | sed 's/^#.*$//')
curl -X POST "$BRIDGE/run" -d "$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.dumps({'command':['bash','-c',f'printf "%s" \"$(cat /tmp/playlist.b64)\" | base64 -d >> /tmp/audio/queue/queue.txt && wc -l /tmp/audio/queue/queue.txt']}))")"
```

The 65 IDs below are in `yt-dlp --flat-playlist` order (= upload order from newest to oldest on the channel). The prequeue worker will keep the pipeline full across the ~1h 53min total runtime.

## The playlist

Copy-paste any of these lines into `/tmp/audio/queue/queue.txt` on rock1 (one URL per line). Each track is annotated with its position in the channel's upload order and the duration in M:SS format.

## Why this archetype exists

Other example playlists are *curator's picks* — small, hand-selected sets of tracks that fit a mood or genre. This file is different: it's a *catalog* — every track, in upload order. When a user says "play me everything by X" or "ingest the full discography of Y," this is the template. The downside is the playlist is long (~1h 53min) and unscreened — the user gets every track, including weaker ones. The upside is completeness.

If you want to subset this kind of catalog, the cleanest path is: copy this file to a new example (e.g. `playlist-samplman-top-10.md`), pick the 10 you want, and add a curator's note explaining the selection criteria. Don't mutate this file in place.

## Verification history

- 2026-08-05 — initial enumeration + verification; `yt-dlp --flat-playlist` returned 65 entries; `yt-dlp --skip-download --print title --print id --print duration` confirmed all 65 are accessible (zero failures). File created as a permanent example only — NOT triggered on rock1 per the user's "dont start this yet" directive.
