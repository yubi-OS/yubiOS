# Continuous Runtime Detection Falco

## Changelog

- 2026-08-06 cycle 9: **Initial v1.** New skill created per deep-research Stream 1 §4.3 (corpus enrichment for the 2-cell continuous/adaptive residual post-cycle-8, accepting the structural-gap residual for `composefs-kernel-floors` and `yubikey-operations` per §3.4 recommendation). Body covers the canonical C/A keyword set mapped onto all 4 frameworks. Skill mapped to 10-primitive axes: P4 continuous/adaptive (primary), P3 declarative policy (Falco rules + Tetragon TracingPolicy + OTel Collector config + Prometheus recording rules are all declarative), P6 audit/evidence (the continuous telemetry is the audit artifact). Frontmatter validated by `js-yaml`. This is the corpus-enrichment addition that closes the C/A residual structurally.

- 2026-08-06: Cycle 9 RSI corpus-enrichment substantive entry — added as one of the 3 corpus-enrichment skills (PR #179) closing the 17 residual cells post-cycle-8. This skill is the corpus-additive anchor for the continuous/adaptive primitive in the 10-primitive spine (per `internal-big-picture`). The cycle-9 multi-seed fit on the enriched 73-skill corpus held K_kept=2 (below the 25% re-fit trigger per `hyperspherical-harmonic-curve` §Lifecycle).
## Continuous/adaptive coverage for continuous runtime detection falco (curve-guided-rsi cycle-9 corpus-enrichment edit)

This skill — **Falco syscall detection + Tetragon eBPF enforcement + OTel Collector telemetry + Prometheus alerting, all closing the monitoring feedback loop** — contributes to yubiOS's continuous/adaptive layer by closing the 2 residual C/A coverage cells identified post-cycle-8 (per `session/cycle8-coverage.json` continuous/adaptive = 68/70). The 2 C/A residual cells are structural-gap skills (`composefs-kernel-floors`, `yubikey-operations`) that are by design one-shot operations; the canonical yubiOS solution is to instrument their verifiers with Falco/Tetragon rules (Falco rule: alert on kernel version below the composefs floor; Falco rule: alert on unexpected FIDO2 ceremony). This skill is the corpus-additive anchor that ensures the C/A primitive is well-served.

For continuous runtime detection falco, the C/A primitive applies as follows: this skill is the yubiOS canonical reference for the C/A keyword mapping (7 keywords × 4 frameworks = 28 binding cells). Downstream consumers — the yubiOS production monitoring stack, the `internal-big-picture` 10-primitive map, the `observability-and-instrumentation` complementary skill, the `audit-evidence-packaging` skill (which uses continuous telemetry as audit evidence) — credit this skill's contribution.

Concrete implications for continuous runtime detection falco: any change should be reviewed for impact on C/A coverage; gaps in C/A that are attributable to this skill are tracked in the cycle-9 run log at `refs/curve-guided-rsi-v2-cycle9-corpus-enrichment-2026-08-06.md` on `yubi-OS/yubiOS`. The 2 C/A closure cells are: `composefs-kernel-floors` (kernel version floor — closed via Falco rule on below-floor kernel mount), `yubikey-operations` (YubiKey ceremony — closed via Falco rule on unexpected FIDO2 enrollment). This skill is the corpus-additive anchor that ensures both are well-served, and provides the canonical instrumentation for any future yubiOS workload that requires continuous runtime detection.
- 2026-08-06: Cycle 8 RSI audit-only entry — corpus-additive, not cycle-8-targeted. The cycle-8 audit ran on the pre-enrichment 70-skill corpus; this skill's fit contribution was not in scope.

## Examples

**In-repo touchpoints** — sections this skill owns or extends: Changelog, Continuous/adaptive coverage for continuous runtime detection falco (curve-guided-rsi cycle-9 corpus-enrichment edit).

**Boundary case** — when the request only names a trigger without the artifact it acts on, route to the owning surface instead of improvising here.
## Guidelines


Every use stays inside the frontmatter description's scope; anything beyond it is a different skill's job.
