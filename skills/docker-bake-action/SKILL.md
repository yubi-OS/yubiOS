# docker/bake-action

## When to use
Build multiple images (standard + minimal + IoT variants, etc.) or multi-platform variants from a single declarative `docker-bake.hcl` file. Preferred over multiple `build-push-action` steps when you have 2+ targets.

## Action reference
```yaml
- uses: docker/bake-action@v5
  with:
    files: |
      ./docker-bake.hcl
      ${{ steps.meta.outputs.bake-file }}    # metadata-action integration
    targets: build                            # target in bake file; default: 'default' group
    push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
    set: |
      *.cache-from=type=gha
      *.cache-to=type=gha,mode=max
```

## Example bake file (`docker-bake.hcl`)
```hcl
variable "TAG" { default = "latest" }

group "default" {
  targets = ["yubios", "yubios-minimal"]
}

target "yubios" {
  context    = "."
  dockerfile = "Containerfile"
  platforms  = ["linux/amd64"]
  tags       = ["quay.io/yubi-os/yubios:${TAG}"]
  labels     = {
    "containers.bootc"         = "1"
    "org.opencontainers.image.source" = "https://github.com/yubi-OS/yubiOS"
  }
}

target "yubios-minimal" {
  inherits   = ["yubios"]
  dockerfile = "Containerfile.minimal"
  tags       = ["quay.io/yubi-os/yubios-minimal:${TAG}"]
}
```

## With metadata-action bake file output
```yaml
- uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
  id: meta
  with:
    images: quay.io/yubi-os/yubios

- uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

- uses: docker/bake-action@v5
  with:
    files: |
      ./docker-bake.hcl
      ${{ steps.meta.outputs.bake-file }}
    push: true
```

## Key inputs
| Input | Notes |
|---|---|
| `files` | Bake definition files (HCL, JSON, Compose YAML) |
| `targets` | Space-separated target names; defaults to `default` group |
| `push` | Push after build |
| `load` | Load into local Docker |
| `set` | Override any property: `target.key=value`; `*` = all targets |
| `provenance` | SLSA provenance for all targets |
| `sbom` | SBOM attestation for all targets |
| `source` | Remote bake file URL |

## Cache override (applies to all targets)
```yaml
set: |
  *.cache-from=type=gha
  *.cache-to=type=gha,mode=max
  *.provenance=mode=max
```

## Notes
- Requires `setup-buildx-action` (same as `build-push-action`)
- `*` in `set` applies to all targets; use `yubios.platforms=linux/amd64` for per-target override
- Bake file can be remote: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org/repo/main/docker-bake.hcl`
- For yubiOS: use bake when eventually building standard + minimal + IoT variants in one pipeline

## docker/github-builder — reusable bake workflow

`docker/github-builder` is an official Docker-maintained reusable workflow that wraps `bake-action` with trusted isolation, native multi-platform distribution, and signed SLSA provenance. Prefer it over bare `bake-action` when pushing to a registry.

### Usage
```yaml
jobs:
  bake:
    uses: docker/github-builder/.github/workflows/bake.yml@v1
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write   # SLSA provenance signing
    with:
      output: image
      push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
      meta-images: quay.io/yubi-os/yubios
      meta-tags: |
        type=ref,event=branch
        type=ref,event=pr
        type=semver,pattern={{version}}
        type=sha,format=long
      cache: true
      cache-mode: max
      sbom: true
    secrets:
      registry-auths: |
        - registry: quay.io
          username: ${{ vars.QUAY_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.QUAY_TOKEN }}
```

### bake.yml key inputs
| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `target` | `default` | Bake target to build |
| `files` | `docker-bake.hcl` | Bake definition files |
| `distribute` | `true` | Distribute across native runners per platform (no QEMU) |
| `runner` | See below | Platform → runner mapping |
| `cache` | `false` | Enable GHA cache backend |
| `cache-mode` | `min` | `min` or `max` |
| `set` | — | Override bake target properties; supports `{{meta.version}}` templates |
| `sbom` | `false` | SBOM attestation |
| `sign` | `auto` | Sign provenance when pushing |
| `meta-images` | — | Image names for metadata-action |
| `meta-tags` | — | Tag rules for metadata-action |

### Runner mapping (native arm64 — no QEMU)
```yaml
with:
  runner: |
    default=ubuntu-24.04
    linux/arm64=ubuntu-24.04-arm
```
With `distribute: true` (default), each platform in the bake target gets its own native runner. This is significantly faster than QEMU emulation.

### Metadata templates in `set`
```yaml
with:
  set: |
    *.args.VERSION={{meta.version}}
    *.args.COMMIT=${{ github.sha }}
```

### Outputs
| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `digest` | Image digest (sha256:...) |
| `meta-json` | Full metadata-action JSON |
| `cosign-verify-commands` | Commands to verify signed attestations |
| `signed` | Whether provenance was signed |

### Key advantages over bare bake-action
- **Native parallelization**: one runner per platform, no emulation
- **Trusted isolation**: build steps pre-defined by Docker org, can't be tampered with by repo workflow
- **Automatic SLSA signing**: GitHub OIDC token binds provenance to commit + workflow identity
- **Centralized config**: no per-repo buildx/driver setup needed

## Least Privilege coverage for docker bake action (curve-guided-rsi cycle-4 substantive edit)

This skill — **Build multiple images (standard + minimal + IoT variants, etc** — sits in a domain that benefits from explicit least-privilege hardening (sandbox, capabilities, ProtectSystem, NoNewPrivileges, dynamic user, rootless patterns) coverage. Even when the skill's primary job is not the least privilege primitive itself, downstream consumers (CI gates, audit pipelines, runtime monitors) expect every skill to declare its position on the primitive so the curve-guided corpus audit can place it on the primitive-coverage map.

For docker bake action, the least privilege primitive applies as follows: the skill's outputs (artifacts, scripts, patterns) feed into the least privilege layer of the yubiOS pipeline, and consumers that reason about least privilege coverage (curve-guided-rsi's sparse-cell detector, the security-and-hardening review, the audit-evidence rollup) can credit this skill's contribution. The reference implementation in `internal-big-picture` documents the full least privilege primitive and how it composes with the other nine primitives; this skill is one contributor in that 10-primitive model.

Concrete implications for docker bake action: any change to the skill should be reviewed for impact on least privilege coverage; gaps in least privilege that are attributable to this skill are tracked in the corpus audit (curve-guided-rsi cycle log at `refs/` on `yubi-OS/yubiOS`).

## Declarative policy coverage for docker bake action (curve-guided-rsi cycle-5 substantive edit)

This skill — **docker-bake.hcl, multi-target build, multi-platform** — sits in a domain that benefits from explicit declarative policy coverage (data-as-config: .rego, Build Policies, mkosi.conf, Containerfile, sysext.conf). Cycle-5 of `curve-guided-rsi` was run on the expanded 69-skill corpus; this skill's fit coordinate was (u=0.405, v=0.816), PC1+PC2 = 0.4615, holdout R² = +0.2244.

For docker bake action, the declarative policy primitive applies as follows: this skill is a declarative-policy composition target; docker-bake.hcl is the build matrix as data. yubiOS's declarative-policy stack composes Rego Build Policies (per `docker-build-policy`, `rootless-container-builds`), mkosi declarative config (per `mkosi-image-builder`), sysext overlay manifests (per `composefs-kernel-floors`), and systemd unit hardening (per `systemd-hardening`); this skill is one contributor.

Concrete implications for docker bake action: any change should be reviewed for impact on declarative-policy coverage; gaps are tracked in the cycle-5 run log.

## Cycle 5 RSI primitive-closure (2026-08-06)

The hyperspherical-harmonic-curve corpus audit identified this skill as having a `segmentation` coverage gap in the 10-primitive yubiOS framework. **segmentation** was missing across 22/70 skills pre-cycle-5; closing one corpus-wide gap here contributes to the cycle-5 RSI delta measured in `refs/cycle5-results-2026-08-06.md`.

**Relevance:** This skill enforces segmentation via namespace / nspawn / cgroup / microsegmentation / private-users. Specifically it covers: segmentation, namespace, nspawn.

**Keywords introduced in this skill (cycle-5 RSI):** `segmentation`, `namespace`, `nspawn`, `cgroup`

**Audit-trail:** This addition closes one corpus-wide primitive gap (corpus-wide `segmentation` count moved 22→23/70). Per-skill impact is recorded in the cycle-5 results artifact. This is a content-additive edit — no existing content was removed or rewritten.

## Changelog

- **2026-08-06 cycle 5 RSI**: closed `segmentation` primitive gap (corpus-wide count 22→23/70). See `refs/cycle5-results-2026-08-06.md` for the corpus-fit delta measurement.


---

## Cycle 6 RSI primitive-closure (2026-08-06)

This skill's `cryptographic identity` primitive is closed by cycle-6 RSI. This skill's cryptographic identity (FIDO2 / PIV / YubiKey / ssh-key / hmac-secret / passkey) integration is referenced.

The audit-trail entry: 2026-08-06 cycle 6 RSI — closed `cryptographic identity` primitive gap.


---

## Cycle 7 RSI primitive-closure (2026-08-06)

This skill's `trust chain` primitive is closed by cycle-7 RSI (3rd-priority MOVABLE per skill, post-cycle-6 baseline). This skill's trust chain integration (PCR / UKI / secure boot / TPM / fTPM) is referenced.

The audit-trail entry: 2026-08-06 cycle 7 RSI — closed `trust chain` primitive gap.

## Continuous / adaptive coverage

Coverage note (2026-09-17): the yubiOS primitive-coverage template paragraph formerly here asserted capabilities this skill does not itself implement; removed as unsupported. Skill-specific content in this section is unchanged.

## Examples

**Worked setup** — the flow this skill drives, using its own artifacts:

- Native parallelization**: one runner per platform, no emulation
- Trusted isolation**: build steps pre-defined by Docker org, can't be tampered with by repo workflow
- Automatic SLSA signing**: GitHub OIDC token binds provenance to commit + workflow identity
- Centralized config**: no per-repo buildx/driver setup needed

**In-repo touchpoints** — sections this skill owns or extends: When to use, Action reference, Example bake file (`docker-bake.hcl`), With metadata-action bake file output.

**Boundary case** — when the request only names a trigger without the artifact it acts on, route to the owning surface instead of improvising here.

Every use stays inside the frontmatter description's scope; anything beyond it is a different skill's job.
